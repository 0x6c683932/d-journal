<h3>Dream #1</h3>
<p>I was on an open field, jurassic park-like with a high fence behind me and some overgrown bunkers and far off hills in front of me. I thought I was safe since the T-Rex should be behind me - behind that high steel fence. I looked ahead and saw a Spinosaurus up on the hill (the frightening sight of the not-so-far-away monster), so I ran towards the fence. As I ran I unlocked a door within the fence with my Casio watch (aka "hacked" it), went through and closed it behind me. I continued to run into some one-level building where other people where hiding. I felt utterly unwelcome and they would've kicked me out if - if the dinosaur wouldn't have been right outside already.</p>

<p>I slowely moved along the wall down below a table. I heared the dinosaur move outside. It stuck its nose inside through the open windows and doors. I felt so frightened until it eventually moved away and I woke up.</p>
<p><i><b>Note: It's the second night in succesion I've dreamt of a lizard monster. The night before it was a T-Rex sized Godzilla.</b></p>
